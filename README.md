üöß **Development Notice** üöß

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Geo-trax is currently in its preliminary stages and under active development. Not all features are complete, and significant changes may occur. It is recommended for experimental use only. Please report any issues you encounter, and feel free to contribute to the project.

**Geo-trax** (GEO-referenced TRAjectory eXtraction) is an end-to-end pipeline for extracting high-accuracy, georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude, bird‚Äôs-eye view drone footage, addressing critical challenges in urban traffic analysis and real-world georeferencing. Designed for quasi-stationary drone monitoring of intersections or road segments, Geo-trax utilizes advanced computer vision and deep learning methods to deliver high-quality data and support scalable, precise traffic studies. This pipeline transforms raw, top-down video data into georeferenced vehicle trajectories in real-world coordinates, enabling detailed analysis of vehicle dynamics and behavior in dense urban environments.

The pipeline includes the following key components:

1. **Vehicle Detection** (‚úÖ): Utilizes a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles) in the video frames.
2. **Vehicle Tracking** (‚úÖ): Implements a selected tracking algorithm to follow detected vehicles, ensuring robust trajectory data and continuity across frames.
3. **Trajectory Stabilization** (‚úÖ): Corrects for unintentional drone movement by aligning trajectories to a reference frame, using bounding boxes of detected vehicles to enhance stability. Leverages the [stabilo](https://github.com/rfonod/stabilo) üöÄ library to achieve reliable, consistent stabilization.
4. **Georeferencing** (üë∑üèº): Maps stabilized trajectories to real-world coordinates using an orthophoto and image registration technique.
5. **Dataset Creation** (üë∑üèº): Compiles trajectory and related metadata (e.g., velocity, acceleration, dimension estimates) into a structured dataset.
6. **Visualization Tools** (‚úÖ/üë∑üèº): Provides tools to visualize the extracted trajectories, overlaying paths on video frames and generating various plots for traffic data analysis.
7. **Customization and Configuration** (‚úÖ): Offers flexible configuration options to adjust the pipeline settings, including detection and tracking parameters, stabilization methods, and visualization modes.

This is a preliminary version of the pipeline with some functionalities not being implemented (üë∑üèº). Future releases will include more detailed documentation, a more user-friendly interface, and additional functionalities.

## Installation

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment** (Python >= 3.9) using e.g., [Miniconda3](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/):
    ```bash
    conda create -n geo-trax python=3.9 -y
    conda activate geo-trax
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rfonod/geo-trax.git
    cd geo-trax
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Batch Processing Example Usage

The `batch_process.py` script can process multiple videos in a directory, including subdirectories, or a single video file.

**Example 1: Process all files in a directory**
```bash
python batch_process.py path/to/videos/
```

**Example 2: Customize arguments for a specific video**
```bash
python batch_process.py video.mp4 -c cfg/custom_config.yaml
```

**Example 3: Process and save visualization for a specific video**
```bash
python batch_process.py video.mp4 --save
```

**Example 4: Save tracking results in video without re-running extraction**
```bash
python batch_process.py video.mp4 --viz-only --save
```

**Example 5: Overwrite existing files with no confirmation prompt**
```bash
python batch_process.py path/to/videos/ -o -y
```

<summary><b>üìÅ Output File Formats</b></summary>
Suppose the input video is named `video.mp4`. The output files will be saved in the `results` folder relative to the input video. The following files will be generated:

- **video.txt**: Contains the extracted vehicle trajectories in the following format:
    ```
    frame_id, vehicle_id, x_c(unstab), y_c(unstab), w(unstab), h(unstab), x_c(stab), y_c(stab), w(stab), h(stab), class_id, confidence, vehicle_length, vehicle_width
    ```
    where:
    - `frame_id`: Frame number (0, 1, ...).
    - `vehicle_id`: Unique vehicle identifier (1, 2, ...).
    - `x_c(unstab)`, `y_c(unstab)`: Unstabilized vehicle centroid coordinates.
    - `w(unstab)`, `h(unstab)`: Unstabilized vehicle bounding box width and height.
    - `x_c(stab)`, `y_c(stab)`: Stabilized vehicle centroid coordinates.
    - `w(stab)`, `h(stab)`: Stabilized vehicle bounding box width and height.
    - `class_id`: Vehicle class identifier (0: car (incl. vans), 1: bus, 2: truck, 3: motorcycle)
    - `confidence`: Detection confidence score (0-1).
    - `vehicle_length`, `vehicle_width`: Estimated vehicle dimensions in pixels.

- **video_vid_transf.txt**: Contains the transformation matrix for each frame in the format:
    ```
    frame_id, h11, h12, h13, h21, h22, h23, h31, h32, h33
    ```
    where
    - `frame_id`: Frame number (1, 2, ...).
    - `hij`: Elements of the 3x3 homography matrix that maps each frame (`frame_id`) to the reference frame (frame 0).

- **video.yaml**: Video metadata and the configuration settings used for processing the `video.mp4`. (this file is saved in the same directory as the input video.)

- **video_mode_X.mp4**: Processed video in various visualization modes (X = 0, 1, 2):
  - **Mode 0**: Results overlaid on the original (unstabilized) video.
  - **Mode 1**: Results overlaid on the stabilized video.
  - **Mode 2**: Results plotted on top of the static reference frame.

  Each version can display vehicle bounding boxes, IDs, class labels, confidence scores, and short trajectory trails that fade and vary in thickness to indicate the recency of the movement. If `video.csv` is available, vehicle speed and lane information can be also displayed.

- **video.csv**: Contains the georeferenced vehicle trajectories in a tabular format with additional metadata (TBD).

- **video_geo_transf.txt**: Georeferencing transformation matrix between the reference frame and the orthomap (TBD).

**Note:** *All output files (except `video.yaml`) are saved in the `results` folder relative to the input video.*
