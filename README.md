üöß **Development Notice** üöß

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Geo-trax is currently in its preliminary stages and under active development. Not all features are complete, and significant changes may occur. It is recommended for experimental use only. Please report any issues you encounter, and feel free to contribute to the project.

Geo-trax is an end-to-end pipeline designed for extracting high-accuracy georeferenced vehicle trajectories from drone imagery. It is particularly tailored for scenarios where the drone remains quasi-stationary, such as monitoring an intersection. The pipeline is optimized for videos captured from a bird's-eye view (top-down) perspective and includes the following key steps:

1. **Vehicle Detection** (‚úÖ): Utilizes a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles) in the video frames.
2. **Vehicle Tracking** (‚úÖ): Employs a selected tracking algorithm to track the detected vehicles in the video frames.
3. **Trajectory Stabilization** (‚úÖ): Maps each vehicle's trajectory to the reference (first) frame of the video, ensuring consistency despite any unintentional drone movements. Uses detected vehicle bounding boxes to enhance the stabilization process. Leverages the [stabilo package](https://github.com/rfonod/stabilo) for this purpose.
4. **Georeferencing** (üë∑üèº): Leverages an orthomap and the reference frame to convert the stabilized trajectories into georeferenced data, mapping the vehicle paths in real-world coordinates.
5. **Dataset Creation** (üë∑üèº): Compiles trajectories and associated metadata (e.g., vehicle velocity, acceleration, and dimension estimates), into a comprehensive dataset.
6. **Visualization Tools** (üë∑üèº): Generates visualizations of the extracted results, including the vehicle trajectories overlaid on the video frames or various plots for traffic data analysis.

This is a preliminary version of the pipeline. Future versions will include more detailed documentation, a more user-friendly interface, and additional functionalities.

## Installation

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment** (Python >= 3.9) using e.g., [Miniconda3](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/):
    ```bash
    conda create -n geo-trax python=3.9 -y
    conda activate geo-trax
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rfonod/geo-trax.git
    cd geo-trax
    ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Batch Processing Usage Examples

The `batch_process.py` script can process multiple videos in a directory, including subdirectories, or a single video file.

**Example 1: Process a Directory Without Saving Output Videos**
```bash
python batch_process.py path/to/videos/
```

**Example 2: Customize Arguments for a Specific Video**
```bash
python batch_process.py video.mp4 -c cfg/custom_config.yaml
```

**Example 3: Process and Save Visualization of a Specific Video**
```bash
python batch_process.py video.mp4 --save
```

**Example 4: Save Tracking Results in Video Without Re-running Tracking**
```bash
python batch_process.py video.mp4 --viz-only --save
```

**Example 5: Overwrite Existing Files with No Confirmation**
```bash
python batch_process.py path/to/videos/ -o -y
```

<summary><b>üìÅ Output File Formats</b></summary>

- **video.txt**: Contains the extracted vehicle trajectories in the format:
    ```
    frame_id, vehicle_id, x_c(unstab), y_c(unstab), w(unstab), h(unstab), x_c(stab), y_c(stab), w(stab), h(stab), class_id, confidence, vehicle_length, vehicle_width
    ```
    where:
    - `frame_id`: Frame number.
    - `vehicle_id`: Unique vehicle identifier.
    - `x_c(unstab)`, `y_c(unstab)`: Unstabilized vehicle centroid coordinates.
    - `w(unstab)`, `h(unstab)`: Unstabilized vehicle bounding box width and height.
    - `x_c(stab)`, `y_c(stab)`: Stabilized vehicle centroid coordinates.
    - `w(stab)`, `h(stab)`: Stabilized vehicle bounding box width and height.
    - `class_id`: Vehicle class identifier (0: car (incl. vans), 1: bus, 2: truck, 3: motorcycle)
    - `confidence`: Detection confidence score.
    - `vehicle_length`, `vehicle_width`: Estimated vehicle dimensions in pixels.

- **video_vid_transf.txt**: Contains the transformation matrix for each frame in the format:
    ```
    frame_id, h11, h12, h13, h21, h22, h23, h31, h32, h33
    ```
    where
    - `frame_id`: Frame number (>0).
    - `hij`: Elements of the 3x3 homography matrix that maps each frame (`frame_id`) to the reference frame (frame 0).

- **video.yaml**: Video metadata and the configuration settings used for processing. Saved alongside the input video.

  - **Mode 0**: Results overlaid on the original (unstabilized) video.
  - **Mode 1**: Results overlaid on the stabilized video.
  - **Mode 2**: Results plotted on top of a static reference frame image.

  Each version displays vehicle bounding boxes, IDs, class labels, confidence scores, and short trajectory trails that fade and vary in thickness to indicate the recency of the movement.

- **video_geo_transf.txt**: Georeferencing transformation matrix between the reference frame and the orthomap (TBD).

**Note:** *All output files (except `video.yaml`) are saved in the `results` folder relative to the input video.*
